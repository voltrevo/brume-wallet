## No venture capital

<div className="h-2"/>

As crypto natives, we avoid traditional venture capital funding and big investors. We prefer to be funded by a big community of users and crypto native people. This way, we stay connected and work together towards common goals.

## No grants

<div className="h-2"/>

To avoid any conflicts of interest, we don't accept grants from other projects. This would make us dependent on them and could influence our decisions. We prefer to be funded by our own community. This way, we can stay independent and focus on building the best product for our users.
